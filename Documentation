    Documentation describing the selected benchmarks and automated installation of the platform.
    
    1: Network latency - netperf
        The netperf request-responce benchmark. Measues round trip network latency.
        System being tested runs server, other machine client.
    2: Network Bandwidth - nuttep
        The measurement of network bandwidth using the nuttcp tool. System under test connects to identical machine.
        Docker connects all containers to bridge and connects bridge to network.
    3: HPC-Linpack
        Dense system of linear euqations. Most operations are double precision floating point multiplication.
        Linpack binary 11.1.2.005 based on Intel Math Kernal Library.
    4: Memory Bandwidth - Stream
        Synthetic Benchmark for sustainable memory bandwidth. Tested using vector operations.
