Deliverable 1:

    Team description: Team 1 Wizard Water
    Documentation describing the selected benchmarks and automated installation of the platform.
    
    1: Network latency - netperf
        The netperf request-responce benchmark. Measues round trip network latency.
        System being tested runs server, other machine client.
    2: Network Bandwidth - nuttcp
        The measurement of network bandwidth using the nuttcp tool. System under test connects to identical machine.
        Docker connects all containers to bridge and connects bridge to network.
    3: HPC-Linpack
        Dense system of linear euqations. Most operations are double precision floating point multiplication.
        Linpack binary 11.1.2.005 based on Intel Math Kernal Library.
    4: Memory Bandwidth - Stream
        Synthetic Benchmark for sustainable memory bandwidth. Tested using vector operations.
    
    For our automatic platform instalaiton will use shell scripts to ensure all nones have the correct tools present
    for testing. These can be used in conjunction with docker compose files to completely automate the creation of
    all relevent test environments.
